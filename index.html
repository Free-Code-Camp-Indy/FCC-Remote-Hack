    <h1>2017 FCC Online Hackathon Rules</h1>

    <h3>Team Composition</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Teams must be comprised of members of a local FCC group, or local coding group.</li>
      <li>There should be no more than seven members per team.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Theme</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>This hackathon has a games theme, all entries must be HTML5 games playable online.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Timeframe</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>This hackathon will be held on Saturday, May 6th. Teams are given the full 24 hours to complete their entries.</li>
      <li>This 24-hour period is determined by the local time zone of each team. Each team must include on their application what time zone that is.</li>
      <li>Github repos must reflect adherence to this rule.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Code</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>All code must be written the day of the hackathon.</li>
      <li>No github repos shall be created prior to the day of the event.</li>
      <li>All languages and frameworks are legal so long as they meet the requirements below:
      <br/>
        <ol>
          <li>The game logic must be written by the hackathon team. Thus, no "drag and drop" game creation engines are allowed (eg. Spark, GDevelop).</li>
          <li>Game frameworks that simplify physics and other low-level functionality are legal (eg. Phaser).</li>
          <li>All games must be playable on the web as HTML5 games.</li>
          <li>No downloads or installation shall be required by users.</li>
          <li>Any frameworks used must be original, open source, or free-to-use. Paid frameworks are illegal.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>The spirit of these rules is that "the team writes the code." Final interpretation of this rule will be decided on by judges.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Art Assets</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Art assets must be original or free-to-use.</li>
      <li>Art assets may NOT be created ahead of the event (This is to keep teams using original art and those using assets available online on equal footing.).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Entry Submission</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Entries are submitted as a link to a functional game, deployed online.</li>
      <li>Game must not require downloads or installation.</li>
      <li>Game code should be visible on Github. A link to this repo must be included in the submission.</li>
      <li>Only one entry per team.</li>
      <li>Games must not contain material that discriminates against or is grossly offensive to any race, gender, religion or sexual orientation. Judges will be the final arbitrators on this rule.</li>
      <li>Mature content is allowed but games should not be pornographic in nature. Judges will be the final arbitrators on this rule.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Judging Criterion</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Judging is on a scale of one to ten in three categories, with one being the lowest score. A score of one should be reserved for games that are non-functional while ten would be a game that is a professional-quality effort.</li>
      <li>The three scoring categories shall be:
        <ul>
          <li><b>Functionality</b>
            <ol>
              <li>Stability of the code</li>
              <li>Quantity and quality of game features</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li><b>Artwork</b>
            <ol>
              <li>Overall aesthetics of the game</li>
              <li>Quality of animations</li>
              <li>Style and originality</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li><b>Player Experience</b>
            <ol>
              <li>Quality of user experience</li>
              <li>Fun</li>
              <li>Quality and quantity of game content</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Judges scores in each category will be averaged for each game, rounded to two decimal places. That game will then be given a total score based on these averages.</li>
      <li>Placement in the competition will be in order of total score, from highest to lowest.</li>
    </ol>
